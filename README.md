# UBER-TRIP-ANALYSIS
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 
UBER TRIP ANALYSIS 

DAHBOARD 1: OVERVIEW ANALYSIS 
Analyse Uber trip data using Power BI to gain insights into booking trends, revenue, and trip 
efficiency, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions. 
KPI’s 
1. Total Bookings – How many trips were booked over a given period? 
2. Total Booking Value – What is the total revenue generated from all bookings? 
3. Average Booking Value – What is the average revenue per booking? 
4. Total Trip Distance – What is the total distance covered by all trips? 
5. Average Trip Distance – How far are customers traveling on average per trip? 
6. Average Trip Time – What is the average duration of trips? 
Expected Outcomes: 
✔ Identify trends in ride bookings and revenue generation. 
✔ Analyse trip efficiency in terms of distance and duration. 
✔ Compare booking values and trip patterns across different time periods. 
✔ Provide insights to optimize pricing models and improve customer satisfaction. 

DAHBOARD 2: TIME ANALYSIS 
 To understand trip patterns based on time, Uber needs to analyse ride demand and trends 
across different time intervals. This dashboard will help in optimizing operations, pricing, 
and driver availability. 
Global Dynamic Measure (Filters All Charts) 
A measure selector will be created for: 
✔ Total Bookings 
✔ Total Booking Value 
✔ Total Trip Distance 
This dynamic measure will update all visuals based on user selection. 
Visualizations: 
By Pickup Time (10-Minute Intervals) - Area Chart 
● Groups trip bookings into 10-minute intervals throughout the day. 
● Helps in identifying peak and off-peak demand periods. 
By Day Name - Line Chart 
● Shows booking trends across Monday to Sunday. 
● Useful for analysing weekday vs. weekend demand. 
By Hour and Time - Heatmap (Matrix Grid) 
● Rows: Hours of the Day (0–23) 
● Columns: Days of the Week (Mon-Sun) 
● Values: Selected Dynamic Measure (e.g., Total Bookings) 
● Highlights peak booking hours across different days. 

DAHBOARD 3: DETAILS TAB 
To provide in-depth insights and allow users to explore granular data, a Grid Tab will be 
created. This tab will enable drill-through functionality, allowing users to access detailed 
records based on selections made in other dashboards. 
Features of the Grid Tab: 
Grid Table with Key Fields: 
● Displays essential trip details 
Drill-Through Functionality: 
● Users can right-click on a data point from other visuals (e.g., charts, heatmaps) and 
drill through to this Grid Tab. 
● Displays detailed records related to the selected data point. 
Bookmark for Full Data View: 
● A "View Full Data" bookmark to toggle between filtered drill-through data and the 
complete dataset. 
● Allows users to reset filters and see all records easily.
