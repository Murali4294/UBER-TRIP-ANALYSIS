# UBER-TRIP-ANALYSIS
BUSINESS REQUIREMENT 
UBER TRIP ANALYSIS 

DAHBOARD 1: OVERVIEW ANALYSIS 
Analyse Uber trip data using Power BI to gain insights into booking trends, revenue, and trip 
efficiency, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions. 
 
DAHBOARD 2: TIME ANALYSIS 
To understand trip patterns based on time, Uber needs to analyse ride demand and trends 
across different time intervals. This dashboard will help in optimizing operations, pricing, 
and driver availability. 

DAHBOARD 3: DETAILS TAB 
To provide in-depth insights and allow users to explore granular data, a Grid Tab will be 
created. This tab will enable drill-through functionality, allowing users to access detailed 
records based on selections made in other dashboards.
